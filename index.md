## About Me

I am a Geriatrician in **Huashan Hospital**(华山医院) affiliated to **Fudan University**(复旦大学).I received my bachelor degree of Clinical Medicine from Fudan University in 2018 and was recommended to study for a master degree without examination in Infectious Disease Department of Huashan Hospital.  
Simultaneously, I undertook an intensive three-year residency in Internal Medicine, honing my clinical expertise. Since 2021, I have served as a dedicated geriatrician in Geriatric Department of Huashan Hospital,anticipating the specialized geriatrics training program in 2023.I actively engaged in the treatment and management of COVID-19 patients, an experience that catalyzed my profound interest in the field of public health.  
During my undergraduate tenure, I had the privilege of joining the esteemed team led by Professor [Shibo Jiang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=5GMHISsAAAAJ),contributing significantly to research on peptide-based HIV fusion inhibitors. Subsequently, during my pursuit of a Master degree, I was mentored by Professor Jiming Zhang, delving into critical investigations pertaining to hepatitis B.  
My contributions to academia are underscored by the publication of seven peer-reviewed papers, which have garnered **a total of 124 citations**. Notably, one of these articles, for which I am the first author, was chosen as the **cover feature** for Journal of Viral Hepatitis,
